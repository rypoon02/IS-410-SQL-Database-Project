# IS-410-SQL-Database-Project
An SQL database meant to simulate a restaurant's ordering/ticketing system. The SQL was primarily done in OracleSQL and features many tables and queries to test the database. This project was to test our database design process and group collaboration. This project was done in collaboration with Gabriel Dennis II, Hudson Pae, and Willis Crosby.
